* Merge all pcap files in /data/pcap to a single pcap file in /tmp (sorts records chronollogically, use -a to prevent sorting)
	mergecap -F pcap -w /tmp/dayone.pcap `ls /data/pcap`

* Filter pcap file for single host communications (to/from IP; -n turns off name resolution)
	tshark -n -r /tmp/dayone.pcap -w /tmp/filtered.pcap -f "host 10.10.10.205"
